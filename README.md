# Password Generator Starter Code

## Description
This challenge required us to add javascript coding to generate a password. This was a very challenging assignment, as I was stumped from the very first get to. I started to pseudocode and map out how to get this completed. Certain things like the function of generating a password was frustrating because unlike HTML and CSS where you can see the very changes you make, javascript does not really show you. By using arrays, functions, math, and different javaScript features I was able to get user info, allow the user to choose what they wanted in their password and what length they wanted it to be. 

## Installation
n/a

## Usage
Users can press the generate password button to get a 8-128 letter password containing uppercase, lowercase, numeric, and special character password. The deployed page can be found here https://nomin97.github.io/password-gen/.
